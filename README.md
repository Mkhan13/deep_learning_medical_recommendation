## Model Evaluation Process & Metric Selection   
- **Metrics:**  

- **Data Splits:** Stratified 80%/10%/10% split for train/validation/test 

All three approaches (naive, classical ML, and deep learning) are trained and evaluated on the same split. The results are compared directly against the naive baseline.
